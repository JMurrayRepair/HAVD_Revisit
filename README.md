A repository to collect the results from re-running a similar experiment to my final year project. This was done as a weekend project.

The code to run this is in the intrinsics.cpp file. This is likely to only run on windows systems. A Linux equivalent to "intrin.h" is able to be sourced, but I did not test this.

The R code is in "CPUID_NOP_Scatter.R" for the various csv files.
